## üí° How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter symptoms in the app.
2. **ML Model Analysis**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts the most suitable medicine based on symptom analysis.
3. **IoT Dispenser Command**: The app sends the dispensing command to the Arduino-based IoT dispenser via Wi-Fi.
4. **Precise Dispensing**: Servo motors dispense the right dose, confirmed in real-time.
5. **Reminders and Alerts**: Notifications keep the user informed about medication schedules and dispenser status.
